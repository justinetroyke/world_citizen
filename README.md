__Purpose of the app__

Gamification of giving back through the purchases you are already making.

A way to encourage companies to build charitable giving into their business model as well as encourage consumers to seek out such products.

* Through World Citizen a user has a passport.
* They can search for products that donates a portion of the proceeds to a charity or non-profit.
* For that product a passport stamp is generated.
* The stamp level will be calculated based on the distance from the userâ€™s location to location of where the charity or non-profit helps people.
* Once they hit complete purchase of the product they are awarded that passport stamp.
* As a user collects stamps in their passport they gain levels of citizenship until they reach World Citizenship.
